# dpi (dp-improved)

An improved version of [dp](https://gist.github.com/masa-fukui/9cc56ca66048f8ec8d34cd3fec8b568d). 

DPI (DuckDB Parquet/CSV Inspector) is a CLI tool that lets users inspect Parquet and CSV files using DuckDB.

It accepts a file path or pattern, detects the file format, creates a temporary DuckDB database and table, and launches an interactive DuckDB CLI session for querying.
